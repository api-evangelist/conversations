  API Evangelist Conversation with Heather Xiao, Founder and CEO at Horizon Zero
  Ltd
description: >-
  Heather and I go way back talking APIs and open banking standards, but I
  invited Heather to sit down and educate me more about Smart Data, and how the
  intersection of APIs and Smart Data can help us bridge multiple industries
  like finance, healthcare, and travel. Heather shared insights on how as a
  community we can speak more in terms of what APIs, data, and standards means
  to actual end-users, framing the API conversation in terms of the meaningful
  outcomes for everyday human beings.

conversation:
  - question: Who are you?
    answer: Hi, how are you? I'm good. I am Heather Xiao.
  - question: What is your role?
    answer: >-
      I, uh, I am, uh, uh, the founder and CEO of a new company called Horizon
      Zero. Uh, I do research, uh, consulting and training on the strategy of
      open banking, open finance and smart data. And also I aspire to be a
      advocate for it as well.
  - question: What is your background?
    answer: >-
      Yeah. Thank you. Indeed. We have known each other for, I think, for 10
      years. So you've been API hero for 10 years and for the many years as
      well. I'm really, uh, I feel privileged to be in your podcast and, um,
      thank you for inviting me. Uh, so I have been in the API, open banking,
      uh, open finance. Uh, well, for the, uh, yeah, past decade, uh, or even
      longer, uh, and, uh, I have been working in the API field, uh, and later
      on, uh, open, uh, open banking field, uh, in different business sectors.
      So, for example, uh, at earlier stage, I was the API, uh, head of API for
      Quantus Airways. Um, then that exposes me to the open concept. Um, then I
      have been working with several banks in Australia and also, uh, back to
      the UK since 2019, um, to, uh, basically work on, uh, progressing open
      banking. Uh, and the reason most recently I was the chief product officer
      at OBIE. So right now it's called OBL, Open Banking Limited, um,
      responsible for the, um, trust framework for the resilience of the
      product, uh, and also, uh, on business development to advocate open
      banking and how it will help our business and help our customers to
      create, to have better life experiences.
  - question: What is Smart Data?
    answer: >-
      Yeah. Um, smart data actually, uh, is a UK term. So, uh, right now in the
      UK, we are working on, uh, actually, we have a lot of energy to progress
      smart data. And smart data basically, uh, is an extension, uh, in my view
      of open banking and open finance. So, there are, uh, open banking, open
      finance, and smart data are all about, uh, securely sharing customer data.
      So, uh, open banking sector for, uh, open banking fors focus on the
      payment sector only. So, payment initiation, account information, uh, so
      using, you know, you can those services to support the small businesses
      and consumers, um, to create innovation. Uh, Open Finance enlarges this
      into the holistic financial services sector. Then smart data, uh, make it
      even further, makes it even further. So, uh, not only, uh, it, uh, Focuses
      on, um, finance, financial services. It also broadened the service, the
      innovation into sectors like education, um, health, transport, uh, energy,
      et cetera. So, uh, it's actually has a much bigger scope, uh, but it will
      deliver much more profound, um, customer experience transformation, I
      believe.
  - question: Is Smart Data about having empathy for end-users?
    answer: >-
      You are absolutely right. So the core of smart data or open banking is
      about data belongs to the customer. Customer owns their data and they
      should control their data. And data should render more. better experiences
      for the customers. And in my view, smart data will profoundly transform
      our human experiences. And so imagine, well, if you think about our
      current industry, they all stem from the human needs, right? For example,
      financial services or transport or health, they all because we have a need
      to, um, To rely on the industry to make our life better. But now with the
      new technology, new emerging technologies or these new business models,
      for example, open banking or smart data, it uses the emerging technology
      to see what are the possibilities we can achieve by using those emerging
      technologies so that we can build more innovative services through better
      leveraging of the data.
  - question: Does paying attention to end-users create better outcomes?
    answer: >-
      It is a very, very good question. Can I? I think in the short term, um,
      better, uh, smart data can create better outcomes. very much. More
      incentive for the businesses, for the industry, I feel is a key challenge
      for us to, um, to work on, to focus on, to really enable the industry to
      have the environment to, uh, can you continue to innovate at the same
      time, realize business value. And I feel, and this is going to
      increasingly become the reality, um, because, uh, smart data is about
      creating the, um, The new services, which we would rely on the business to
      create, to innovate. And so that I think new opportunities will emerge
      more and more as we build out more and more success.
  - question: Is it better to focus on real-world outcomes over the technology?
    answer: >-
      Absolutely. I think if you look back when we have been working on open
      banking user adoption, customer adoption, it has been, um, Yeah. A good
      success so far. Absolutely. But at the same time, it has been a challenge
      because in my view, open banking only all focuses on one area, which is
      payment, but customer experience. Let me talk about, um, when we create a
      new, uh, Good customer experience for a, um, a more, uh, vetting platform.
      For example, it involves different business sectors to make that holistic
      experience work, but if you only rely on payment itself and it's very
      difficult to achieve that, then we have the, um, smart data. in place,
      then we can use the, uh, the shareable data, standardized shareable data
      across different business sectors so that we can create much more
      meaningful services to support the, you know, the new wedded couples, for
      example, uh, or many other use cases, uh, many other customer experiences.
      areas, for example, in health, um, and in transport. Um, if I, I give you
      another example, uh, in, in, in the health sector, um, how smart data can
      render better value for the human beings. Um, for example, if I say my,
      um, Uh, one day my my grandmother, uh, may, uh, feel fell ill and I I'm
      going to take her to the emergency center to to receive treatment. And at
      this point in time, um, it's highly likely that when I take her to the to
      the health center, um, they may have the existing record of my
      grandmother's to to understand her, uh, health history or what, uh, what
      is her, um, You know, the medicine she cannot take or et cetera, et
      cetera. But when we have the smart data, then, um, you can, um, you know,
      if you can imagine, um, each of the health centers, uh, NHS or the, uh,
      uh, medical centers, they all have the medical history of my grandmother
      and they all know, uh, what, uh, medicine is effective to her, uh, what
      blood type she has. So. Uh, this data having it in place will really save
      so much time and also the money for the, for the health industry as well
      to give effective in time treatment, uh, for my grandmother. And
      furthermore, uh, if, for example, we have the variable, um, like product,
      so like a smartwatch, for example, that can, um, monitor my grandmom's
      health throughout the, you know, the months and the years, and so that we
      can provide, um, rather than reactive payment, but preventative, uh,
      treatment through the use, usage of smart data that will massively lift
      the health service, um, to patients, uh, like my grandmother. So, so I
      think there's millions of those cases, use cases that, um, we can, um,
      Pursue and once we have the capabilities in place and I would firmly
      believe that transformative experiences will be given on to us as human
      beings and also it will benefit our society as a whole.
  - question: Should technologists talks less about APIs and more about business?
    answer: >-
      Uh, yeah, another great question. I think the, We should talk, uh, both of
      them because, um, I think, you know, today's age and technology driven
      innovation has become very prominent. And that's because we, we are using
      technology or APIs as a catalyst to create new changes. Uh, and now we
      have technology in place. Then we have to work with the businesses and
      with the regulators and with the government to Make sure that we create
      the environment for technology really to deliver the value it should
      deliver to us. Um, so I, I felt, uh, we should, um, pursue the progress
      in, in all these areas, including technology, business regulation, um,
      and, um, yeah, just creating the environment, the ecosystem for everyone
      to, uh, contribute.
  - question: What keeps you going each day?
    answer: >-
      Um, yeah, I think, um, um, I, I love the fact that APIs actually connect
      us so closely to meaningful connections with the world. I think that's,
      Probably why intuitively from, um, you know, years ago, I felt this
      connection of turning data into useful information in an organization. And
      that that was where I started to do. And that was so beneficial for a
      customer or for for the customer using, um, internal and internally. And
      then now we, uh, once we have the useful information, we use APIs to Um,
      turn the information into knowledge, into executable actions, insights,
      and so that we can use the information, join them across business sectors,
      even to create more meaningful experiences. To me, I felt is, um, is very
      profound. And, and that's what I, love to do. And actually my, um, I think
      my, um, aspiration is that I could, uh, help with the smart data industry
      to, um, to draw, join the dots and create almost like, help to create
      almost like a tube map or London underground map, like mapping system so
      that, uh, With the power of APIs and we can, um, and together with the
      ecosystem to create value. And I think that that's what's what my value is
      at.
