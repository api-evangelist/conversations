  API Evangelist Conversation with Dale McCrory, Software and Product Management
  Leader at Breeze Strategy
description: >-
  I had a conversation with Dale McCrory, Software and Product Management Leader
  at Breeze Strategy about the business and product manager view of the API
  landscape. I am eager to hear from veteran API product managers like Dale
  about how we convince leadership to invest in APIs, but also API product
  managers. Dale has a healthy view of the business of APIs, and how this
  applies across the many different types of APIs we produce and consume--which
  is something we need more of in the API world to help balance our heavy focus
  on the technology of APIs over the last decade.

conversation:
  - question: Who are you?
    answer: >-
      Hi. My name is Dale McCrory, and I'm an experienced product manager doing
      A P I S in the enterprise and technology industry. And SAS world for a
      long time and, uh, currently have a consulting company that I started up
      as well, um, to kind of help, help others with their strategies and
      technology strategies. And, uh, and so that's kind of what I've been
      doing, doing this for over 20 years at this point, I think.
  - question: Why should business leadership care about APIs?
    answer: >-
      Yeah, it's, it's a, it's a great question. Um, a lot of times in the, in,
      if we're just talking about the enterprise space before you get into like
      software as a service and that sort of thing, but if you're a normal
      classical enterprise, a lot of your integrations, uh, historically have
      been going directly to databases. You might have a, you might have
      developers who are used to doing it that way. And they've, they've built a
      lot of, a lot of integrations to databases and over time, what happens is
      not only do you lose those developers and, you know, but, but you're also
      losing out on opportunities for business agility. So being able to
      actually use data in different places in a quicker way. And, um, and, and
      this is, and it's a, it's an aspect of how many, how many people need to
      know about change as well. So there's a big change management aspect to
      APIs. It's probably one of the leading, leading needs that you need as a,
      as a business owner in the enterprise world or business manager is like,
      Hey, how do I know that I didn't make a change in system X that impacted
      system Y? Especially when you get a lot, a number of teams working on a
      single, single problem. And then, you know, you always get like, well, why
      didn't, why didn't this team tell me about the change over here? Do you
      know what, like, that's a great question. We should have done that. You
      know, and then someone says, well, if we had a good, really nice API
      around here, we could have actually, you know, made a non breaking change.
      And you would have never, you never would have even known that we made
      that change. Right. And that's a spot that a lot of enterprises are still
      in as their teams are trying to work together. Right. And, and, you know,
      like sticking to, uh, an API first mentality, uh, limits, limits risk. And
      that's a big deal.
  - question: Why do businesses need an API product manager?
    answer: >-
      Yeah. I mean, they're technical configurations, but they have a life cycle
      and that's the key thing. Um, with, with API is the moment you introduce
      an API. So you, you've, you've solved the risk problem by introducing the
      API. So you got the risk problem solved, but now you, you've done, you've
      added this new thing that has a life cycle, has multiple versions, and
      you're gonna have to live with it forever. So even as if one, if your
      business, if your business needs change, this API needs to change in an
      orderly fashion. And, and it needs to be, you know, treated like a
      product. And, you know, that has versions that has a business problem that
      it's solving, you know, that eventually might get deprecated if it's not
      solving the right business problem. And most classical product managers
      aren't able to really get their head wrapped around that. And there is
      direct revenue implications for it, depending on the types of integrations
      you're doing, um, an enterprise might be doing. A strategic integration,
      right? So there's a difference between a strategic integration and
      ecosystem, right? A strategic integration is I'm an enterprise
      corporation, and I'm strategically going to integrate in with one of my
      key suppliers, right? That actually requires a fair level of thought. That
      isn't a UX problem, but it will be around forever. And as your business
      evolves and as your suppliers business evolves, You need to keep iterating
      those systems and
  - question: What are the different types of APIs?
    answer: >-
      That's a, that's a great question. That's a great question because Yes.
      Typically when the first thing a product manager gets hit with APIs is
      just because their developers are building a single page application and
      they need REST APIs to connect to react or something like that. So there's
      a bunch of REST APIs that are built. They're using authentication tied to
      JWT or some front end mechanism. And, you know, and then they're like, Oh,
      we've got APIs. And then someone's like, okay. That's great. Um, that's
      called an internal API, by the way, that's a private internal API. It's
      not designed for public consumption, but then someone's like, okay, we do
      need to do this strategic integration. They're like, well, can we take
      that one that we built for the UI over there to kind of like use it for
      the strategic integration? And the developers are like, no, it really
      wasn't designed for that. And then someone's like, well, how do we
      actually repurpose? I mean, the functionality is there. The contract kind
      of exists. The business process is really cludgy. It'd take like eight API
      calls over here, but we really need an API that does like all that and
      like one API call. And then somebody needs to think that through and
      design that is that an architect, you know, a product manager gets in
      there and says, well, I understand what needs to be in there and what
      doesn't. And that's really what, um, you know, at that particular stage,
      you know, you're looking at before you get to the ecosystems and trying to
      build all sorts of other external public stuff.
  - question: How do you generate value from APIs?
    answer: >-
      Um, well, I mean, traditionally, traditionally the you, an API is
      introduced. For the strategic integration, which is a, which, which is the
      first step in a partner ecosystem, right? Strategics are to your first
      step in a partner ecosystem saying, all right, my business, my sales team,
      my executives say we need to actually have a tight technology relationship
      with this other vendor. Okay. Well, the API product manager says, okay, I
      see the business value of that tight relationship with this, with this set
      or set or multiple one or many vendors, and we're going to build some APIs
      to make sure that we can facilitate those integrations internally. And
      there's a direct business value there because now you have the sales and
      the marketing capacity But when you get into enterprise sales and say well
      We want it We have a lot of problems to solve and we know we can't we
      can't solve all these problems with just a couple strategic vendors you
      know and um And we would really want to enable like any vendor to solve
      these problems on top of our platform Now you switch from an application
      play to a platform play And now you're talking about indirect revenue that
      your sales team is able to acquire new deals because they are able to talk
      about relationships and functionality that they weren't able to do when
      you were just playing in more of an application space and application
      domain.
  - question: Are APIs more than just technical?
    answer: >-
      Yeah, because if you're, if your application or platform has, I don't
      know, 47, 47 features can, if you got 47 features and someone says, well,
      we got to build an API, you have to determine which of those 47 features
      are the ones that drive value and ultimately are going to help sales,
      right? Because you can't like just say, okay, we're going to, because
      you're, you're not, no one's going to give you the time to build out an
      API for all 47 things. Um, and that's a business problem. Um, what's
      important?
  - question: What is the difference between API and SDKs?
    answer: >-
      Yeah, that's a great question. So the API is, is typically built for a
      business purpose to solve a business problem in a specific way, but that
      API needs consumers in order to be successful by itself. The API is just.
      You know, it's just like, you know, a piece of piece of mail that hasn't
      been delivered yet, but the consumers are actually what drives value to
      that. And the SDKs make it easier for those consumers to, to add value to
      your organization. Um, and the, but, but the SDKs themselves are only so
      good. If you wrap an SDK around a poor API, then you're not going to have
      many consumers either. Right. That maybe the API hasn't exposed a couple
      of key features. I've seen this multiple times where there's an API
      strategy, but a couple of the key features aren't there. So no one's
      actually able to really, really use the API, even though the company may
      have invested like a hundred thousand dollars in the whole strategy. So
      far, you know, um, so that's kind of a, um, you know, the SDKs are, are
      the thing that makes it easy to use. Um, and for developers, it's, it's
      called developer experience now in the realm of developer experience and
      developer experience matters because you can get things done quicker. So,
  - question: What keeps you going each day?
    answer: >-
      Yeah, I mean, I, I enjoy solving problems and recognizing that, um, I'm,
      I'm a creator, I'm a builder, right. And the way that things get built in
      a proper way. Is when you have the right contracts in the right, uh,
      abstractions in place. And, um, and APIs are the primary mechanism for
      that. And, um, and it's also, there's a lot of creativity even in the
      world of APIs, depending on whether you're doing event event driven or
      whether you're doing. Bulk APIs and Salesforce is a really good example.
      If you look at Salesforce's. APIs and the, all the variety of APIs that
      Salesforce has produced. They're actually solving different business
      problems for each of their API patterns. And that's really fascinating
      when, to me, that's fascinating to me again, not if other people may not
      geek out about that stuff, but I'm like, man. I know why Salesforce
      introduced that API because they were trying to solve that business
      problem, you know, and that was the only pattern that could do it. Um, so
      that was, um, so that's what I love.
