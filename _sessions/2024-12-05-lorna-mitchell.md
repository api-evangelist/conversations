title: API Evangelist Conversation with Lorna Mitchell, OpenAPI Specification Maintainer with the OpenAPI Initiative
description: Lorna Mitchell, OpenAPI Specification Maintainer with the OpenAPI Initiative, and overall API experience expert came by to educate me (us) on OpenAPI Overlays, helping contrast with the core OpenAPI spec, as well as with Arazzo Workflows, sharing how it will help bring more stakeholders into the API lifecycle and contribute to better API experiences. Lorna is a well spring of knowledge when it comes to OpenAPI, but also other specifications, as well as Spectral and other approaches to governing APIs, and she'll be coming back shortly to help educate us all about the intersection of overlays with extensions and how it all will change API experience.

conversation: 

  - question: Who are you?
    answer: Hi, my name is Lorna. I am actually day job wise, I am between jobs, but you will know me as API enthusiast, um, documentation specialist, developer experience specialist, um, open source, um, cheerleader. Um, and I'm one of the many things that I do is I'm involved with the OpenAPI initiative. So I think about APIs a lot, even when I'm not paid to. 

  - question: Do you do better work in between jobs?
    answer: Yeah. And I think, you know, you've got to take that moment and like, just do something you're right. It did ship something else really API ish. And in between the last job and. The one before and then this one, yeah, but I think also the focus, the focus time helps and I love to work on API stuff like I did some very cool things in my last role, but now I'm picking the stuff to work on. So that's also very cool. I just have everything's great. 

  - question: What are OpenAPI Overlays?
    answer: Overlays are a way of describing repeatable changes that you make to your OpenAPI description. So if you have something where there's a missing endpoint, or that description's not quite right, or you want to ship another version of your OpenAPI that doesn't have those particular operations in it, overlays is what lets you repeatedly make that change.

  - question: What are the most common use cases for OpenAPI Overlays?
    answer: I think the one about taking out the internal endpoints is Really, really relevant. And this, this happens everywhere, right? And I think there's something there about, Oh, we can't put that in our OpenAPI description because we can't expose it to these people. And so we're maintaining these similar but slightly different descriptions. Overlays fixes that. Like, you've got your full fat everything in the kitchen sink that serves All of the possible purposes and then, you know, maybe your closest partners are going to get the whole thing and they're going to have access to those restricted endpoints. But for everyone else, you're just going to take out, remove those endpoints, um, and ship them a reduced, uh, And you can be removing individual files or fields or endpoints or whatever makes sense in your context. So I think filtering things out, actually, is, is one of the big use cases. Um, overall enriching, especially for organizations that generate their OpenAPI description from code. Can be a little bit thin in terms of rich descriptions with markdown and links and really lively examples. If you're, if you're generating from code, even with annotations, it's very difficult to get a real user experience richness into that workflow. Well, with overlays, you can add that in. So you can have like these are the endpoints and then you can replace or in praise. the extra data around the different fields or different endpoints. I think the third major use case that I, I mean, what people will build with overlays. We don't know, cause it's quite new, but, um, so far the third really big thing that I see is adding particularly extensions, but specific fields or metadata for a specific output destination. So hints for your SDK generators, you might not want to have to have that in all the way through the API description. Pipeline before you, before you generate your SDKs, you want to add the extra fields, the same going out to API gateways, to some extent, the same going out to docs platforms as well. Some of them have great extensions, but you might not want to, you were complaining the other day about having all the code examples as well. You might want to just put those in as a last stage before you publish to docs and not everybody might need the whole for other destinations. 

  - question: Will OpenAPI Overlays move API experience forward?
    answer: I think so. And I think it also. One of the things that, that has made overlays like really stay with me is I think that it solves the problem that every organization has. Like it's difficult to generalize API advice because every organization is different and they're at a different place in their life cycle, in their terms of their API maturity, and they already have some sort of setup. Like most people are not in implementing their first APIs today. Nearly every organization has something. And overlays. The input is OpenAPI, you add an overlay, the output is OpenAPI. So it's not disruptive to what you have, it's just additive, or removitive, if you're filtering things out, right? So it fits in really well, and I, for that, and it uses things you already know, and there are already tools to use it. So I think it's, It, it, it massively improves the experience and it opens the door to getting the best from all the tools you can use with open API, even if you're a not design person, all of those metadata fields are in right at the start. Like you can still use all that stuff. It, it just, it brings more people in to have more possibilities, I think.

  - question: Will OpenAPI Overlays allow more stakeholders to get involved with APIs?
    answer: I think it really helps. And again, especially if you are not design first. So if it's kind of originating from server code, and then we expect to have everything given to us on a plate, I think if you don't bring, if you don't bring everyone together at the beginning and get those things right, then that's a, that's a big, that's a big thing. Um, and I think overlays, yeah, let's everybody bring their own thing. And in open API, we've talked a little bit in the process of working on Moonwalk about, you know, it's the shape of the API. Separate from the deployment details, you know, and maybe just because the servers are probably separate and maybe if you're on the sandbox server or local development, you don't have the same security requirements like this with the gateways and everything. There's a lot of deployment specific stuff. It's, it's all in open API. So I can see us adding that later. Had an interesting chat with, um, an NGO a couple of weeks ago who deploy with different gateway rules in different regions because they're regulated differently in those places. So you can just be like, okay, so this is the shape of the API. So the OpenAPI isn't a snapshot, it's a pipeline. And before we go out to those geographic regions, the last thing we do is we add those extra things with an overlay. One per region, and then off we go, and we're set. 

  - question: Can OpenAPI Overlays be associated with API lifecycle stages?
    answer: Yeah, I think so. And I'm also seeing things like we've got everything we need, but we'd love to localize our API description for documentation, you know, like, great, then you can have an overlay that that changes the texty bits and publishes that without having to hold all of that within your open API description, you can add it with an overlay.

  - question: Can OpenAPI Overlays be part of a code-first approach to APIs?
    answer: Yeah, I think so. And I think it really closes that gaping chasm. Mm hmm. between, you know, how far can you go with generated code and how far can you go if you really design it first. And I have been very vocal. Let's, let's be clear about that. I have, I have criticized generated open API descriptions, but a lot of organizations don't have a lot of OpenAPI awareness. They do generate, and it means they can only do so much, or, yeah, the engineers have to put everything in at the start. And so that we can even begin to work with this OpenAPI. So I now need to stop criticizing people who are not designed for, I mean, I think there are still benefits. Right, to getting things like having technical writers in the room, having beautiful descriptions and examples before we build the thing, because then we're going to build the right thing, because we're not just going to be like, ah, build an endpoint that does something. Right, it's really, really beautifully well rounded. We know exactly where we're going and why. So there's still benefits to design first, but I think we've really increased the mileage of where you can go if you are generating. from a code base. And that's the entry point to your open API. And again, it's not a snapshot. It's a pipeline. So we start with this and then we do these things. And then maybe we combine them or filter them. They go to different destinations, different add ons for docks and gateways and testing and client SDK things. Um, and so we get all these like different versions, but we're not maintaining all those different versions. We're not repeating edits. We have it all in overlays and it just flows out every time. 

  - question: What has been the tooling response to OpenAPI Overlays?
    answer: So actually, the tools existed before the specification was published with overlays. So I have had overlays on my mind for a long time, and you talked about, oh, I push things out between jobs. In the gap between the job I've just left and the one before that, I shipped a really basic overlays library, because that, even after two years of Ivan thinking about databases, I still had this thing where we had sort of talked about overlays, but it didn't exist yet. And there was a, there was a draft spec. Anyway, then I didn't think about it a lot more, but it, it, it became obvious to me earlier this year that We have tooling already, people have implemented that draft specification is labeled as a 1. 0, but it isn't an official release. And so I spent half a year cleaning that up, so that we could release it in support of those existing tools. So there's a list in the, um, we have it in the readme for the overlays project, so that everyone has to go and look there, and if you go and add a new tool, people will find it. Um, there are tools. I'm using them. You can use them already. 

  - question: Can OpenAPI Overlays help with the OpenAPI 3.x tooling adoption?
    answer: I think so. I think it will really I think overlays is a very practitioner focused thing, so I can't take a lot of credit for this. The draft was just there, all I've done is release it, right? It's there, I know we need it, the hard work had been done, and we have to support those tooling. people by being like, yeah, this is the official, you absolutely support it. But it's, it opens the door to very many of those other very cool tools in the API space. A lot of them use extensions. A lot of them, like a testing tool, will need to change where your server URL is to send the test requests through, or to send you to a mock server. And overlays kind of is a great mechanism for doing that. So I think it, I think overlays will bring a lot for tooling and, and give us a nice add on. And I don't think it's a coincidence that the two of the kind of big early implementers for overlays are a bump. And Speakeasy. So these are two organizations that are really active with exciting new tools and overlay supports. the things that they are already doing, adding the metadata for their users, you know, speakeasy, it's an SDK generator. You cannot generate great SDKs without extensions. There are different languages need different hints, different metadata overlays makes that really possible to implement into an API workflow. Um, so I think it'll help in terms of, but I also think it's not the only thing that's going to make the difference. I think OpenAPI Initiative has had a big renaissance this year. The community is active. There are not 650 abandoned issues. The weekly technical meetings are alive and well, and sometimes a bit lively, because I usually chat. It's mad. Um, we have released two new standards. We're at more events. Like, these are the things that I'm going to educate our audience and help  them to be ready to use new tools. And I think that's part of the story for your users have to be ready. Otherwise, why would a tools vendor support the new version or, or try to upgrade? So it's, I really feel we're reinvigorating the whole landscape and this is just part of the story.
