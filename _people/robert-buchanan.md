name: Robert Buchanan
bio: I'm a former developer and accidental marketer. I believe the best way to reach more developers is through education, not promotion. After being a technical journalist for Wired and editor of ProgrammableWeb, I brought that perspective to the provider side. I ran developer communications at email API SendGrid and developer marketing for API automation tool Zapier, among others.
