bio: Hiya I've been working in developer education since 2007, before that I worked in public sector arts venue management for several years and did a load of temp jobs in various other industries. I specialise in developer learning and enablement on community software products, most recently Glitch. Highlights include designing education strategy at Postman and building out the platformâ€™s initial training and certification program, and co-founding a non-profit that partnered with the Mozilla Foundation on a series of open education events. I'm currently Senior Learning Experience Manager at Fastly, focused on building cross-functional learning strategy and empowering people to build the web!
