bio: I'm an expert in developer evangelism and advocacy, web technologies, Jamstack and more with a passion for teaching others. I've written about, and presented on, technologies for the past twenty years and enjoy helping others become passionate about the web as well. My ideal role is as an evangelist/developer advocate where I can help others learn about new technologies and products. I write at raymondcamden.com (approximately 300K page views per month) and other industry publications. I've authored (and contributed to) multiple books over the years and speak at conferences around the world.
