            <h2>About API Evangelist Conversations</h2>
            <p>This is the conversation wing of API Evangelist. I have learned so much from the conversation I've had via API Evangelist over the last decade, with enterprise customers during four years at API Evangelist, and the 125+ Breaking Changes conversation I had. So, for the next chapter of API Evangelist I want to roll all this up into a series I am simply calling API Evangelist Conversations.</p>

            <p>I will be prioritizing conversations with API consumers, then API producers, and then service providers, analysts, VCs, and other actors. Not every conversation will make the cut, but I am open to having a conversation with anyone with a compelling role in an interesting industry, and has good answers. I am also looking for a diverse range of voices as well as an international presence.</p>

            <p>The first couple of sessions are recorded by me to jump start things. I will keep conversations to 10-15 minutes maximum, work to keep the question concise, a keep the answers short. I will strive to publish one a day, but won't worry if that doesn't always happen. I am just looking to keep a steady stream of diverse voices flowing through my world each day, shifting how I see the API universe -- hopefully yours too!</p>

            <p>Beyond the conversations, I am looking to aggregate questions and answers across a variety of topics, and continue to use to inform my storytelling and services I offer to my customers. Each guest will be linked under the people section, and the industry they operate within under the industries section. So, getting at the data and intelligence behind these industries is my ultimate goal. I am looking to get my finger on the pulse of what is happening like I did at Postman with customer and Breaking Changes conversations--however, this time I have different priorities.</p>

            <p>I am introducing another unique feature to API Evangelist discussions. My guests can be on the record or off the record, and I will obfuscate their name, company, face, and voice. I am looking to be an outlet for anyone looking to share their story off the record. This was one of the realities of operating API Evangelist in the early days--I had a lot of conversations I had to write about anonymously. I am just looking to replicate this in a video and audio format--not just blog posts.</p>

            <p>When I record each session I will publish audio and video, and generate a transcript. I will publish here to the site as YAML for each session, people, and industry listing, and link up with the transcript. Then I will make it all searchable via the primary search bar for the site, and add to the main API Evangelist website. I am looking forward to what I learn, and explore the insights I am able to extract as I connect the dots across the sessions, questions, and industries.</p>
