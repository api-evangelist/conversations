title: API Evangelist Conversation with Jamie Tanna, Engineering Productivity at Elastic
description: Jamie and I connected on the API's You Won't Hate Slack channel, where I started subscribing to his blog. After reading a post on versioning, and more specifically why you should start the version for your API at 0.1.0 instead of 1.0.0, I knew I needed to have him come for a conversation. I really enjoyed Jamie's calm and pragmatic approach to what web APIs are, what Semantic Versioning is, and how versioning and change management can really help us enable both API producers and consumers to stay aligned.

conversation: 

  - question: Who are you?
    answer: Hey Ken, I'm Jamie Tanner.

  - question: What is your role?
    answer: I am a number of different things. Um, so I have ADHD, which also means that feeds into lots of different things. So I'm a blogger, I'm a software engineer. I'm a collector of open source projects. Um, uh, most notably recently the OAPI CodeGen, go open API to go code generator. It's all my big ones.

  - question: What is difference between web APIs and other APIs?
    answer: Yeah, so, um, for, there's a mix. There's both library APIs and web APIs. And so the library APIs, I would see as, for instance, a Go or npm package that has a public interface that you as a consumer will use and you will opt in generally to pull a new version of that dependency, which then at that point you would discover if anything's broken, which with a web API that's usually either distributed over HTTP or TCP. Um, things like RESTful APIs, GraphQL, um, gRPC. Those are the sorts of things that you don't really have as much control over. Because for the most part, a Web API is something managed by someone else that you get access to straight away. Whereas, as I mentioned, with something like a library, you pull in that new version of the dependency, and until you've pulled in that new version, you have the old version available.

  - question: What is Semantic Versioning?
    answer: So semantic versioning is a way of providing, as you say, a precise meaning to what a version looks like. Um, so most commonly version number looks like version 1.2, 0.3, and in semantic versioning it. prescribes a clear meaning to the one at the beginning. Uh, the first number will be the major version. Then the second number is the minor version, and then the third is the patch. And so between each of these, there's a hierarchical, um, and clear contract for consumers. So the idea is that within the patch version, you would generally, fix things, um, or introduce things that don't provide any public facing change. Um, the minor version is generally here's a new feature that we've added, um, and something useful for you. And then for the major version it's, we have broken something. So beware. Um, and so semantic versioning with web APIs is an interesting one because for the most part, people don't care. about the minor and patch version. They really just care, has something broken. Um, and a lot of times it's useful to know, is there a new feature available? But it's primarily, is everything broken? And do I have to do some work to integrate with you? 

  - question: Why should you start an API with 0.1.0 version?
    answer:  Um, so you brought up an interesting point. So, as I mentioned, the major version, say version one. indicates has something broken. Um, but as computery people, we like starting counting from zero. And so the zeroth major version basically says anything could be breaking here. And it gives you brilliant opportunity to say, I want to work out actually what my API looks like. What should my interface be for my customers and my users? Um, and it allows you to break things safely. So you still have, um, a communication tool in terms of there is a breaking change, um, where you would, for instance, if you're on your 0th minor, um, major version, you would bump your minor version, and that could either be a feature or a breaking change. So for people using your API, they need to be much more aware, um, and keep an eye on things a lot more. But it does also mean it's that you as the producer of the API can experiment. You can work out that something that you dreamed up at night, um, and thought was a great idea, actually is awful to work with for consumers who are coming from strongly typed languages, where they can't reasonably describe your API in their type system. Or it could just be things like, you know what, it, it just doesn't make sense. Um, the, you know, The way that your routes and everything are planned doesn't make a lot of sense. Um, and especially one of the problems, um, with web APIs is they're much harder to do breaking changes with. So, um, I'd say especially with like a version zero, introducing those breaking changes, your customers and your users are going to be feeling those breaking changes every time they send a request. Um, so at least making it clearer that you are a v0 API. Makes it so your consumers can maybe be a little bit more defensive and they can work out. Okay. Actually, I'm expecting Version 0. 7. It looks like you sending version 0. 11. So I'm gonna try and do as much as I can with what I understand But maybe they need to do some future work to actually pick up the new changes.

  - question: What are other ways to communicate API change?
    answer: So as well as just like the pure version number, which could be in like a header or a URL, there's also things like your change logs and your release notes. and having like long and short form means to actually communicate to people. Um, they're a great opportunity to very visibly, like top of the big release note, say, here are a load of breaking changes. Please be aware that these things need to be done and where possible, like try and make it as actionable as possible, um, to help people understand. Okay, these are the things I need to actually do and um, even sometimes you may be fixing a bug. There is a great XKCD about someone relying on holding down their spacebar and it heating their computer and they're like, oh no, I use that to keep warm. Um, and so one of the problems is people will start relying on Functionalities or even a bug fix that you put in someone may see that as actually a breaking change So sometimes you actually need to call out those bug fixes more carefully because some people may Be relying on that functionality, especially Before you've stabilized your API.

  - question: What API providers do versioning well?
    answer: So, I had trouble thinking up, um, some of these answers because I think that one of those things is you shouldn't really have to think about it, right? Um, and there aren't many that actually come to mind in terms of, oh, I love the way you do versioning. Um, but I will say, I know GitHub have recently Um, started doing database versioning and clarifying some of that stuff. Um, the way that in particular in the Kubernetes ecosystem does it, is they'll have like, um, V one, alpha one, V one, alpha two, V one, beta one, and then they will go through different variations until they stabilize on V one. And one of the nice things about that is that's very clear in like the objects that you interact with in terms of what version it actually is. And it gives you that control of saying, actually, I do not understand this version, so I'm just going to reject it, um, or throw an error, whatever. Um, I'm actually sorry. That does remind me, um, Stripe have written in the past. So Brenda Leach, um, a very brilliant person in the API community wrote a really good post about how Stripe does API versioning and they support. Every version in perpetuity and it's things like that like, um, for you as a consumer, you don't actually need to worry about versioning because they support all any of the docs that you see the work. Um, on the provider side though, I can imagine that is a very complex piece of work because you need to be able to reason about things in dozens of different ways over the years as your underlying models may have changed. You still have to think about it. In terms of, okay, a decade ago, we were saying this, so we still need to be able to represent it in this way. Yeah. 

  - question: What keeps you coming back?
    answer: So I, just about a year ago, joined Elastic, and I'm on our, one of our platform developer experience teams. And for me, one of the things that keeps coming up is I enjoy trying to make things easier for people to work with. This was something that over the last eight ish years, I've spent a lot of time on APIs because it's trying to provide that good developer experience that is consistent for people, that provides something that you can just look at it and be like, Oh, okay, that, that seems reasonable. Generally, you want people to be writing and reading docs, but also if it can be somewhat straightforward to read and understand how it should look, um, and to provide organizational standards in a way that things look and feel like a single suite of APIs, even if it's built by a dozen different teams. Um, that's the sort of thing that kind of gets me going, trying to keep on building good stuff.
